#  Assignment 008/2 profit calculation
#  Task - 1 :
#  You work for a manufacturer as a programmer and have been asked to 
#  calculate the total profit made on the sales of a product. 
#  You are given a dictionary (sales) containing the cost price per unit (in dollars), 
#  sell price per unit (in dollars), and the beginning inventory. 
#  Write a program to return the total profit made, rounded to the nearest dollar.
#  Assume all of the inventory has been sold. The name and the keys of the dictionary are constant,
#  so use them as they are.
#  Task - 2 :
#  Your boss wants you to prepare the payrolls of the workers in your department. 
#  You have to convert the amount of dollars into payroll format. 
#  In order to help move things along, you have volunteered to write a code 
#  that will take a float and return the money in the following format (as dollars and cents). 

sales = {

  "cost_value": 31.87,

  "sell_value": 45.00,

  "inventory": 1000

}  

cv = sales["cost_value"]

sv = sales["sell_value"]

inv = sales["inventory"]

gain = (sv - cv)* inv

gain = int(round(gain))

print(gain)
